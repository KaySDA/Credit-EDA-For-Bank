# Credit-EDA-For-Bank
This case study aims to demonstrate how to use exploratory data analysis (EDA) in a real-world business scenario. Specifically, we will use EDA to identify patterns in loan applicant data that can be used to predict whether a client is likely to have difficulty paying their installments
Business Understanding

Loan providers often struggle to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers with insufficient or non-existent credit history. This can lead to two types of risks:

False negatives: Qualified borrowers are rejected for loans, which can result in lost business for the lender.
False positives: Unqualified borrowers are approved for loans, which can result in financial losses for the lender if the borrower defaults.
The dataset provided in this case study contains information about loan applicants at the time of application, including two types of scenarios:

Clients with payment difficulties: These borrowers had at least one late payment of X days or more on at least one of the first Y installments of the loan in the sample.
All other cases: These borrowers paid their installments on time.
The goal of this case study is to use EDA to identify patterns in the data that can be used to predict whether a client is likely to have difficulty paying their installments. This information can then be used to mitigate the risks of false negatives and false positives.

Business Objectives

The specific objectives of this case study are to:

Identify patterns in loan applicant data that indicate a higher risk of default.
Understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
Develop a predictive model that can be used to identify borrowers who are at high risk of default.
The findings of this case study can be used by the company to improve its portfolio and risk assessment processes. For example, the company could use the predictive model to:

Deny loans to borrowers who are at high risk of default.
Reduce the loan amount or increase the interest rate for borrowers who are at elevated risk of default.
Monitor borrowers who are at high risk of default more closely.
Conclusion

This case study will demonstrate how to use EDA to identify patterns in loan applicant data that can be used to predict whether a client is likely to have difficulty paying their installments. This information can then be used to mitigate the risks of false negatives and false positives, and to improve the company's portfolio and risk assessment processes.
